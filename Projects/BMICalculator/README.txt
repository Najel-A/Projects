This is a BMI calculator tool that converts your weight and height to your BMI. It uses Python's GUI, Tkinter where
the user types in their height in inches and weight in pounds that then converts your Body Mass Index (BMI).
The program outputs your BMI as well as a message which can be sassy.
*Remember these are just a rough estimate each person's body is different. Remember to always look after your health!*
