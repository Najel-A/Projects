In this project, I used computer vision to make a motion detector. It detect any form of motion, but with the higher video quality the more problems the motion detecter faces drawing multiple motion detections rather than just one motion detection. 
You may use your own video clips to test it out.
***Recommended to use "Sample4.webm" for best results"***
