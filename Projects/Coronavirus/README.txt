In this program I used pygame to help create a simulation of the infection of the global pandemic Covid-19 (Coronavirus). I created a dot.py which contains a class and methods that is used in all scenario cases. Each scenario is different to represent the stages we had went through.

In Scenario 1, we assume that it was just the flu and continued on our normal day, but there was a chance to become sick or infected with the disease.

In Scenario 2, people began to practice social distancing of 6 feet to reduce the chance of catching the disease while others do not. (The outer circle of dot represents the 6 feet distance)

In Scenario 3, we have the Shelter-in-Place take place where people stay home and practice social distancing. Yet, there are people who don't practice Shelter-in-Place, but practice social distancing. Lastly, there are select few who don't follow either.
